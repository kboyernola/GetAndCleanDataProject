DATA DICTIONARY - TIDY_DATA.TXT

Introduction
This data set was produced by averaging the 3rd through the 81st variables by Activity and Subject across
a set of 10,299 individual measurements.  

Activity	 30	Factor
	Note: The activity the subject was engaged in when the data was collected
	Values: 
		LAYING
		SITTING
		STANDING	
		WALKING
		WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
		WALKING UPSTAIRS

Subject		2	Integer
	Note: An integer number assigned to a specific subject participating in the study
	Values: The integers 1 through 30


The rest of the 81 variables were calculated by taking the mean of each of these same variables
from the original data set available at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The original data set was derived from accelerometer and gyroscope data generated by a smart phone
while each of the 30 subjects engaged in one of the 6 activities.  A single record in the data 
set represents the mean for each of 79 measurements for a particular combination of activity and 
subject.

Additional information about the underlying variables can be found in the features_info.txt file 
that comes with the original data set.

The following variables are all of type numeric and fall in the range of -1 to +1.
